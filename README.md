## 🔁 Workflow Overview

1. **Data Simulation & Ingestion**
   - Generate synthetic industrial energy consumption data
   - Store in PostgreSQL or local Parquet files
   - Automate ingestion using Python or Airflow

2. **ETL Pipeline**
   - Clean and transform data (e.g., using Polars)
   - Feature engineering: time of day, weekday, temperature impact
   - Aggregation at hourly/daily levels

3. **Forecasting Model**
   - Train regression or LSTM model to predict short-term energy demand
   - Evaluate with metrics like RMSE and MAE
   - Save model using `joblib` or `MLflow`

4. **Peak Detection & Flexibility Activation**
   - Identify consumption peaks above a threshold
   - Flag time slots for potential load shifting

5. **Deployment & CI/CD**
   - Containerize with Docker
   - Set up CI/CD with GitHub Actions (or Bitbucket Pipelines)
   - Monitor pipelines and retraining jobs
